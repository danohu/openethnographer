## Open Ethnographer for Drupal

**Note:** _The Edgeryders OÃœ company does no longer develop or support this strain of the Open Ethnographer software and we consider it legacy code. Instead, you may be interested in [Open Ethnographer for Discourse](https://edgeryders.eu/t/6811). Its code._


### What is this?

Open Ethnographer is a software to add ethnographic coding right into live online content. It is an open source plug-in for Drupal 7, and we use it to add semantic markup to edgeryders.eu content, empowering both our ethnographic research, website visitor's navigation and discovery, and semantic search engines.
